## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Get Testnet STX (REQUIRED) ✅

**✅ DEPLOYED - Your Testnet Address:**
```
ST3DSAPR2WF7D7SMR6W0R436AA6YYTD8RFT9E9NPH
```

**✅ DEPLOYED - Contract Address:**
```
ST3DSAPR2WF7D7SMR6W0R436AA6YYTD8RFT9E9NPH.stackflow-options-v1
```

**Transaction ID:**
```
ee51046f5c0f9ce1003c000cda5ebb415b13736c5a5d811c94085df98cbdc6f2
```

**Verify Deployment:**

---

### Step 2: Generate Deployment Plan

```bash
cd /Users/abba/Desktop/stack-flow/contracts/stackflow-contracts
clarinet deployments generate --testnet
```

This creates `deployments/default.testnet-plan.yaml`

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Testnet

```bash
clarinet deployments apply --testnet
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying on testnet...
✔ Contract deployed: stackflow-options-v1
  Transaction ID: 0x...
  Contract Address: ST1CS6D7VNBJD300QT2S2SKXG9C36TV1KAT63222S.stackflow-options-v1
```

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

**Check on Explorer:**
https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/[TRANSACTION_ID]?chain=testnet

**Verify Contract:**
https://explorer.hiro.so/address/ST1CS6D7VNBJD300QT2S2SKXG9C36TV1KAT63222S?chain=testnet

## 🧪 Test the Contract on Testnet

### Using Clarinet Console:

```bash
clarinet console --testnet
```

### Test Commands:

```clarity
;; Create a CALL option
(contract-call? .stackflow-options-v1 create-call-option 
  u10000000    ;; 10 STX
  u623000      ;; $0.623 strike (current price)
  u700000      ;; 0.7 STX premium
  u1100        ;; ~7.6 days from now
)

;; Get option details
(contract-call? .stackflow-options-v1 get-option u1)

;; Get protocol stats

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Checklist

After successful deployment:

- [ ] Verify contract on explorer
- [ ] Note contract address
- [ ] Test create-call-option
- [ ] Test create-strap-option
- [ ] Test create-bull-call-spread
- [ ] Test create-bull-put-spread
- [ ] Verify gas costs
- [ ] Update frontend config with contract address

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testnet

Once testnet deployment is verified:

1. **Update Frontend (Phase 3)**
   - Add contract address to `.env`
   - Create transaction manager
   - Update TradeSummary component
   
2. **Test Integration**
   - Connect Leather wallet (testnet mode)
   - Create test options from UI
   - Verify transactions

3. **Prepare for Mainnet**
   - Security audit
   - Gas cost verification
   - Mainnet deployment

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**

1. **"Insufficient balance"**
   - Get more testnet STX from faucet
   - Wait for faucet transaction to confirm

2. **"Nonce error"**
   - Wait a few blocks
   - Retry deployment

3. **"Contract already exists"**
   - Check if already deployed
   - Use different contract name or version
